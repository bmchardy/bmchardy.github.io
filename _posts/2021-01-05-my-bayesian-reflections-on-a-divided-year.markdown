This year has been many things — a year of much needed racial reckoning, a year of facing and trying to understand grief and loss at a personal and global scale, and a year of political division.

All are critical to reflect on, but the latter, it seems to me, underpins them all. If we do not have a common basis of fact on which to understand each other, the democracy that all parties mutually strive to protect — in their own ways — falls apart.

Part of the problem is our increasing reliance on statistics as 'fact'. (This is almost painful for me to write because I work with statistics daily in school, work, and research. I would *love it* if my statistics were fact.)

Both left and right now use statistics to 'prove' their point, but statistics are not fact. Instead, they reflect a very specific model of *approximated* fact: an attempt to measure a narrow portion of our world. Critically though, their result is partially dependent on the researcher's selected measure — what the researcher determines to be of import.

In this way, two parties can end up stymied; both rhyming off seemingly contradictory statistics. ("Both of us can't be right." In fact, neither are 100% correct.)

The 2020 solution, instead of trying to understand one another, is to be a true Trumpian and claim "fake news" or "alternative facts". Statistics are a science. Not a pure math. They are not perfect, but that's the point; they're only the best tool we have to contend with the complex bits and pieces of the world.

An emerging and growing branch of statistics called Bayesian statistics recognizes that statistical outcomes depend on the researcher's prior beliefs and mental models. In this way, statistical findings are predicated on subjective evaluations of the world. To be a true Bayesian, one must consider the underlying assumptions that were made in interpreting the available data.

Next time your acquaintance of an antithetical party spits off a "fact" you "disagree" with, before you fact check, ask yourself: "Can my model of the world co-exist with theirs?"

This understanding and acceptance of differences leads to true democratic unity; the kind that will keep this free world going for centuries to come.

Best of luck in the new year.
