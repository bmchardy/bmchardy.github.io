# Welcome to my website!

Hey! My name is Bobby. I'm an undergraduate student in Honours Research Psychology and Mathematics at the University of Waterloo, minoring in Computing. My interests include music, culture, and data.

I made this website to showcase a little bit of what I'm working on and so that my diverse interests can have one cohesive home.
