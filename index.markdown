Hey! My name is Bobby.

I am a motivated and hardworking incoming clinical psychology graduate student. I have spent the last five years at the University of Waterloo where I studied psychology, mathematics, and computer science. I believe this unique skillset will help me in my pursuit of a meaningful career of research and practice in clinical psychology.

With professional experience in addictions, counselling, information technology, statistics, and mathematics tutoring, I bring a diverse (and sometimes quirky) set of skills to the table that prove surprisingly cohesive across my wide range of volunteering, academic, and professional activities.

An avid volunteer, I have served as Vice President of both the Psychology Society and the Mathematics Society at my school and am a Peer Mentor for students with low-level mental health and wellness concerns.

I always have some sort of side project!
