Hey! My name is Bobby.

I am a motivated and hardworking undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo where I study psychology, mathematics, and computer science. I believe this unique skillset will help me in my pursuit of a meaningful career in clinical psychology.

With professional experience in addictions, counselling, information technology, and mathematics tutoring, I bring a diverse (and sometimes quirky) set of skills to the table that prove surprisingly cohesive across my wide range of volunteering, academic, and professional activities.

An avid volunteer, I have served as Vice President of both the Psychology Society and the Mathematics Society at my school and am a Peer Mentor for students with low-level mental health and wellness concerns.

I blog about things that interest me. I always have some sort of side project!
